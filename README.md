# Automatic_Attendance-System
## Objective/Introduction
•	The objective of an automatic attendance system in real time could be to simplify and streamline the process of taking attendance.

•	 The accuracy should be improved thus, reducing the time and effort required to manually track attendance.

•	To reduce errors which occur with manual attendance tracking, by using a more secure and reliable technology like facial recognition.

•	To create a more efficient and accurate attendance tracking system that saves time and resources for businesses, schools, or other organizations.

## Methodology/Implementation
•	The dataset is created by taking 50 images of the person by the camera.

•	In pre-processing of data, the resizing of the image and the data augmentation is done.

•	Firstly, the model is trained to identify the faces in each image by using the haar_cascadefrontal_face pre-trained model.

•	Then, the model is trained to recognize the face associated with its name.

•	The attendance of that particular face is marked in the csv file.

## Outcome/ Results/ Future Scope (social, environmental impact)
•	It can provide a range of benefits to organizations, including improved accuracy, time-saving, real-time tracking, improved efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
•	Future Scope: 
  	  It could be used to reduce the potential for errors or fraud.
  
  	  To implement it on a hardware device and create a stand-alone system.
  
•	Environmental Impact: The Reduction of Paper and Energy efficiency means Low power consumption.
